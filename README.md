#Parseangular

Parseangular is an [AngularJS](http://www.angularjs.org) specific module for interacting with the [Parse.com](http://www.parse.com) BaaS platform

Although parse has a JavaScript SDK. It's modelled on the Backbone way of working with Models and Collections. This is a bit clunky in Angular land and leads to having a lot more information floating about that is required.

This implementation is designed to work with plain objects so adding items from parse to the scope doesn't become a headache.
